Blinkenlights diagnostics! 

Quasi useful diagnostic board - shows activity on the A500's expansion bus connector using LED's. May be useful for determining if certain signals aren't working on faulty boards. May also just look cool.

It's a 4-layer PCB though, due to the sheer number of signal traces, and also for neatness.
